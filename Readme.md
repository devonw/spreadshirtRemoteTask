Spreadshirt Remote Task
=====

I was asked by spreadshirt to develop a relatively simple web application.
This application:
* Should use the public spreadshirt shop API
* Should use Es6/7 and React
* Should work on mobile devices

How to use:
-----

* Use `npm install` to install the dependencies from `package.json`.
* Use `npm test` to run tests.
* Use `npm start` to run the development server.

Retrospective:
-----
I was very excited about this initially for two reasons:
* I had used neither React nor Jest so far, and was curious how they would work out.
* The timeframe for implementation was originally rather short.

Since I was wondering how much time this project would take me I tracked it myself:

Total:                 13.5
```

I'm rather pleased with React
and I think that it would have been a good fit
for some projects I was involved in.
